# MinecraftRailroading
Cool Minecraft mod with some ResourcePack's.


Ook, Below I will put the download links for each ResourcePack & Mod I use on my railroad. (Maybe I forget to update the list, but overall that's it).


<b> --- Mods --- </b>

! Remembering that all mods MUST be used at the same time, otherwise the experience will be broken and a lot of essentials will be missing.


<b> --- ResourcePack's --- </b>


ResourcePacks are preferred, if you don't want to use it, you will still be able to use the mod without any problems, the mod already comes with some trains, ResourcePack's just add more trains made by the community. You can choose to have one or the other, it's not mandatory to use them all at the same time, and as I said above, if you want, you don't even need to. There are several other ResourcePacks that add more trains, so feel free if you want to use more, usually creators post their creations on the official Mod Server, I'll leave the link at the end.

https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/ir-british-freight-addon-pack - British Trains

Remembering that these ResourcePack's not only include trains, some come with freight cars and passenger cars. (All are interactive)

You can find more ResourcePack's to add to the Mod at these links:


https://www.curseforge.com/members/trainman264/projects - Mod Co-Creator Projects (There are some Resource Packs that add content to the Mod there)

https://discord.gg/KBb7vaBmc4 - Mod server in Discord. (There are people there to help you with questions, give you tips, share projects, interact, and also several additional content packs to the Mod!)


ResourcePack's work on 1.16.5 (As far as I've tested, just need to have all mod's up to date). It will appear that it is incompatible, but it works. On the game server they say it's better to use mods in 1.12.2, I don't remember why, but it was something to do with delay;
